# Docker image kubectl-yq

This is quiet simple here - just a Docker image with kubectl and yq installed.

This image will build every two weeks and push it to the ghcr.io registry.

```bash
# Pull from ghcr.io (GitHub Container Registry)
docker pull ghcr.io/taskmedia/kubectl-yq:main

# Pull from Docker Hub
docker pull fty4/kubectl-yq:main
```
